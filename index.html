            <p>Welcome! My name is Jacey Tupa and I recently moved to Portland, Oregon from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Born and raised in North Dakota to a white, middle-class, Catholic family, I always had desires of a more cultured, city life. After earning my Bachelors in Psychology from the University of North Dakota I packed my car, and made my first big move to the metropolitan of Minneapolis, Minnesota. I forgot to mention this was done with no money in my pocket, no job offers, and no sense of where I was going. I learned so much about myself, and life, living in a larger area, but some of the lessons were tough. Anxiety and depression became a prevalant part of my day to day flow. After a four year battle, I found the balance I needed to start going after my new goal: coding. Check out my Explore tab to learn where I've been, where I want to go, and how that influences the journey I pursue every day.</p>
